# Frequency-based investigations of Paleoclimate Records
*A reproducible, data-centric exploration using LinkedEarth Tools*

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that use the frequency domain to explore the relationship between **external climate forcings** (particularly **solar irradiance** and **orbital forcing**) and **paleoclimate variability** across a range of timescales, from the Commom Era to the late Pleistocene. The notebooks are designed as a **narrative introduction to modern paleoclimate data analysis**, combining standardized data formats, programmatic data discovery, and transparent time-series analysis in a fully reproducible environment. These notebooks are meant to be used as both research and teaching resources.

## Scientific Motivation

Understanding how external forcings influence climate variability is a central question in paleoclimatology. However, detecting these signals in proxy records is challenging due to age uncertainty and irregular sampling, proxy-specific sensitivities, internal climate variability, and the risk of false positives in spectral analysis.

This project emphasizes **statistical rigor**, **careful significance testing**, and **physical interpretation**, rather than simple pattern matching.

---

## Core Questions

The notebooks address questions such as:

- Is there a consistent relationship between solar irradiance and climate over the Common Era?
- What periodicities emerge in a large compilation of Holocene temperature-sensitive records?
- How consistent are spectral signals across archives and regions?
- How does orbital forcing manifest in high-resolution records from glacier ice and marine sediments?
- What are the limitations of common spectral and coherence methods in paleoclimate applications?

---

## Notebook Structure

The notebooks are intended to be read roughly in the following order.

### 1. Is there a solar signature on Common Era climate?

**`01-solar_climate2k.ipynb`**

Explores the relationship between solar forcing and temperature reconstructions over the last two millennia, including exploratory analysis, visual comparison, and discussion of coherence, significance, and interpretation.

---

### 2. Exploring the spectral properties of Holocene climate records

**`02a-query_lipd_graph.ipynb`**

Introduces graph-based discovery of paleoclimate datasets using LiPDGraph and SPARQL, demonstrating how metadata-driven queries can be used to assemble analysis-ready datasets.

**`02b-spectral_analysis_temp12k.ipynb`**

Applies spectral analysis techniques to temperature records from the Temp12k database, focusing on methodological choices and their implications.

**`02c-spectral_analysis_peaks_temp12k.ipynb`**

Identifies and evaluates spectral peaks, with emphasis on red-noise benchmarks, uncertainty, and archive-dependent behavior.

---

### 3.  Orbital and millennial variability in two iconic records

**`03-EpicaDomeC_explore.ipynb`**

A deep dive into the EPICA Dome C ice core, exploring long-term variability, spectral structure, and interpretive challenges.

**`04-IODP339-U1385.ipynb`**

Analyzes orbital-scale variability in a marine sediment core, linking observed periodicities to orbital forcing while highlighting uncertainty and methodological caveats.

## Tools and Data Ecosystem

This project builds on the open paleoclimate software and data ecosystem, including:

- [LiPD (Linked Paleo Data)](https://lipd.net) for standardized data representation
- [LiPDGraph](https://linkedearth.graphdb.mint.isi.edu) for metadata querying using graph technologies
- [PyLiPD](https://pylipd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for opening and manipulating LiPD files. 
- [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for time-series, spectral, and coherence analysis
- Public paleoclimate data repositories such as [NOAA NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology) and [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de)

All analyses are designed to be **transparent, inspectable, and reusable**.

---

## Intended Audience

This material is intended for:

- Graduate students learning paleoclimate data analysis
- Researchers transitioning to Python-based, reproducible workflows
- Instructors seeking working examples of spectral and wavelet analysis 
- Researchers interested in big data paleoclimate synthesis

Some familiarity with time-series analysis and basic climate concepts is helpful, but the notebooks are written to be pedagogical and exploratory.

---

## Reproducibility and Reuse

- All analyses are performed in Jupyter notebooks
- Code and narrative are interleaved to support transparency
- The repository is suitable for use as a Jupyter Book
- Users are encouraged to adapt workflows to their own datasets

If you reuse this material, please cite the relevant datasets and software packages.
